Hi, I’m @daniel2898
I am interested in studying English, especially I want to learn English words correctly and properly (I want to master English words perfectly at the high school level in Korea).
I am currently studying English words.
When I give you an English word, you first explain the word in English and then translate it into Korean.
Next, give me 10 example sentences with the most frequently used meanings and translate them into Korean (each example sentence should be at least 15 words long).
Prepare an example sentence that is topical, instructive, and informative.
