Hi, I’m @daniel2898
I am interested in studying English, especially I want to learn English words correctly and properly (I want to master English words perfectly at the high school level in Korea).
I am currently studying English words.
Parts of speech for English words I give you 
For the first word, explain its meaning in English and interpret it in Korean.
Then, show about 10 example sentences in order of the most used meaning and English structure.

For each example sentence, add an interpretation in Korean.
The length of the example sentence should be at least 15 words. 
The level should be at a high school English level.
Prepare an example sentence that is topical, instructive, and informative.
